An individual moves an average of 11.7 times in their lifetime. In fact, in America, between 2012 and 2013, a total of 35.9 million people aged one year or older moved. There are various reasons for moving like Job Relocations, Changing Neighborhoods, Marriage or Retirement. My primary reason for moving is job hunt. Boston, MA has done a fine job of attracting young professionals in abundance over the years with their reputed educational institutions, diverse communities, and access to world class healthcare.\n\nSafety is key when looking into moving to a new place and the level of crime provides insights with respect to that. The report is targeted towards individuals who are planning to move into Boston or individuals who are in Boston and are planning to move within the city.\n\nThe aim of this project is to:\n1. Find the safest neighborhood in the city of Boston, Massachusetts. \n * It's determined by looking deeper into the number of crimes per neighborhood. \n2. To explore the top 10 common venues in the safest neighborhood by street and cluster them using K-means clustering.\n * The venues are extracted using the Foursquare API.\n \nBy the end of the analysis, I or any individual should be able to narrow down which street to move into in the neighborhood identified as the safest."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "# Data Acquisition \n\nThe data is extracted from [Analyze Boston](href=https://data.boston.gov/), which is an open data hub of the city of Boston. The data set that will be used is [Crime Incidents Report](href=https://data.boston.gov/dataset/crime-incident-reports-august-2015-to-date-source-new-system). These are reports provided by the Boston Police Department to document the initial details surrounding an incident to which BPD officers respond. The dataset contains records from the new crime incident report system, which includes a reduced set of fields focused on capturing the type of incident as well as when and when it occurred. The record begins in June 2015. Since the analysis is focused on safety, the latest year i.e 2019 is considered. \n\n**_Metadata_**:\n* **Incident_num**: Internal BPD report number\n* **Offense_code**: Numerical code of offense description \n* **Offense_Code_Group_Description**: Internal categorization of[offense_description]\n* **Offense_Description**: Primary descriptor of incident\n* **District**: What district the crime was reported\n* **Reporting_area**: RA number associated \n* **Shooting**: indicated a shooting took place\n* **Occurred_on**: Earliest date and time the incident could have taken place\n* **UCR_Part**: Universal  Crime Reporting Part number (1,2,3)\n* **Street**: Street name the incident took place\n\nThe key columns used in the analysis are District, Offense_code_Group_Description, Street as well as the latitude and longitude of the various streets in the dataset."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.6", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.6.9", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
